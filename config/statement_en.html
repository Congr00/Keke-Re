		The player starts each level at a set position on the map defined by the level. <br>
        On each turn of the game, the player may do one of the following things:<br>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Attempt to move to an adjacent cell</b> in any direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN)</li>
		  <li><b>Use a button</b> the player is standing on (USE)</li>
		  <li><b>Reset</b> the level (RESET)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        Each level has a set turn limit in which the player must win. The player loses when:
        <ul>
          <li>They fail to win the game within the set turn limit</li>
		  <li>They fail to make a move within the response time per turn (100 ms)</li>
        </ul>
		<br>
		The robot’s vision is limited and can only see set distance ahead (radius = 4). Each turn, the player receives basic information about all objects it can see. There can be multiple objects on a single cell of the map. Objects come in two categories: static and interactive.
		<br>
		<br>
		Static objects are defined by their group number. <b>All objects within the level with the same group number have exactly the same attributes.</b> There are 4 possible attributes that an object can have:
        <ul>
          <li>Win condition – the player wins the level upon stepping on the object.</li>
          <li>Immovable – the player cannot enter the space on which the object resides.</li>
		  <li>Trap – upon stepping on the object, the robot is destroyed. The level is reset, and the player is returned to the initial spawn point. Trap takes precedence over Win condition.</li>
		  <li>Blocks vision – the robot’s vision cannot reach beyond the object with this attribute. Intuitively, the player will not see any object which on a straight line from the player to that object has another object with ‘Blocks vision’. For detailed algorithm see: http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php/FOV_using_recursive_shadowcasting_-_improved </li>
        </ul>
		<br>
		An object with no attributes is the same as floor and can be stepped on without any consequences. Each object can potentially have any combination of the available attributes. <b>When seeing a static object, the player is only provided its group number and whether it has ‘Win condition’ attribute.</b> The presence of any other attributes is hidden and can only be deduced by the player through interaction with the object.
		<br>
		<br>
		We furthermore define 2 groups that are the same across all levels:
		<ul>
			<li>Group 0 (Floor) – no attributes</li>
			<li>Group 1 (Wall) – Immovable, Blocks vision</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		Interactive objects (referred from here on as buttons) can be used to change the behaviour of static objects. All buttons come in one of two possible variations: change and transform.
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Change buttons</b> target any single group of static objects and toggle the presence of any single predetermined attribute for all objects with that group number. 
		<b>Transform buttons</b> target any single group of static objects and transform all objects of that group number into objects of any different predetermined group number.
		Each button can only affect a single group or/and attribute at a time. The button can only be used when the player is in the same cell as in which that button is located. When seeing an interactive object, <b>the player is only provided with the group number that the object will affect. However, this number is hidden until the button is interacted with.</b> The player has to deduce what a button does exactly by examining an object of the group that was affected.

    Each object on the map is visualized according to the initial attributes it possesses, which are not normally visible to the bot. In this level, the player has to reach the left-up corner (group 2) while avoiding spikes (group 3). Each object can be examined on the display by mousing over it.

		'Properties' is comma delimited string consisting of following possible parts: 
		<ul>
			<li><b>OBJECT_TYPE:<int></b>, indicates the object is of static type and denotes its group number, e.g. OBJECT_TYPE:5 means that the object belongs to group 5</li>
			<li><b>WIN_POINT</b>, indicates the static object has the attribute ‘Win point’</li>
			<li><b>INTERACT:<value></b>, where value can be either int or ?. Indicates the object is of interactive type (a button). The integer value describes which object group is affected, and is only visible after player used the button at least once, otherwise value is set to ?.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		Example properties string: ‘INTERACT:?’ or ‘OBJECT_TYPE:2,WIN_POINT’.
